**1. The background:**

Based on our project from the previous quarter (Chambers &amp; MacLean, 2016), we pinpointed several aspects of the paper that we would have wanted to explore further. The paper combined simulation and _ex-vivo_ methods to evaluate neural network connectivity motifs. It provided evidence for basic characteristics of physiological networks based on their physical limitations and reliability. We developed a number of questions based on the results of the paper. One of these was whether the network model would display different dynamics if the network - like the cortex - was intrinsically plastic. Using a combination of synaptic plasticity modelling (Tsodyks, 2005) in a network of neurons with conductance-based synapses (Brunel, 2000), we hoped to extend the Chambers &amp; Maclean original model (Chambers &amp; MacLean, 2015).
